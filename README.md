# Iron Dome Simulations

Welcome to the **Iron Dome Simulations** project! This repository is aimed at simulating the workings of the Iron Dome missile defense system. Whether you're interested in missile trajectory prediction, interception algorithms, or simply contributing to an exciting simulation project, you're in the right place!

## How it Works

The Iron Dome system is designed to intercept and destroy incoming missiles before they reach their targets. Our simulation aims to model:
- Missile detection
- Interception timing
- Missile trajectory prediction
- Real-time interception algorithms

By creating a simulation environment, we can explore various defense strategies, optimize interception logic, and visualize how the Iron Dome system might perform in different scenarios.

## Features
- **Missile Detection:** Simulates radar-based detection of incoming missiles.
- **Trajectory Prediction:** Uses physics-based algorithms to predict missile paths.
- **Interception Logic:** Develops an interception strategy to destroy the incoming missile in mid-air.
- **Real-time Visualization:** Displays the simulation in real-time, showing the missile paths and interceptions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To get started with the Iron Dome simulation, you will need the following:
- Python (or the language of choice for the simulation)
- Relevant simulation or physics libraries (e.g., `pygame`, `math`, etc.)
- [Optional] Visualization tools for real-time rendering
